# ðŸ“– Activity 1: Service implementation for Customer module

## Task Overview

Your first task is to implement the **Customer Data** database structure based on the diagram below with some endpoints.

## ðŸ“Œ Database Diagram

There is a PDF file in the database folder containing the complete database model, including the tables for **Customer
Data*8. You can also use MySQL Workbench to view all the details by opening the rental-store.mwb file.

## Steps:

1. **Create a new database** in PotsgreSQL named `rental_store` and change the configuration in the `application.yml`
   file inside the folder `customer/resources`.
2. Map the JPA entities for:
    - `country` (already mapped)
    - `city`
    - `address`
    - `customer`
3. Ensure that:
    - Foreign key relationships are correctly implemented.
    - Data types match those in the diagram.
    - Primary keys are set properly.
4. When the application is run, Spring should create all tables in the database.
5. Create all the necessary logic to implement the following endpoints for each entity:
    - Find All
    - Find One
    - Insert
    - Update
    - Delete
6. Create an endpoint to filter data from the `customer` entity where::
    - The results must be paginated, displaying 10 elements per page.
    - It should filter by `first_name` or `last_name` based on the given input.
    - The input must be at least two characters long.
    - The JPA generated query must similar to:
      `select * from customer where first_name = '%str%' or last_name = '%str%'`

7. **Commit your changes** and push them to your forked repository.
